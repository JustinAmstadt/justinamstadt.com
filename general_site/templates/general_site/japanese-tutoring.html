                            <p>Have you tried learning Japanese before and never seem to make any progress? Are you interested in Japanese and just don’t know where to start? I can help get you on the right track.</p> 
                            <h3>About Me</h3> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>I began studying Japanese 6 years ago and I am n1 level.</li>
                                <li>English is my native language. This means that I can give precise explanations while nonnative English speakers might struggle.</li>
                                <li>As some of my students might tell you, I am extremely patient.</li>
                                <li>If a native Japanese teacher hasn’t learned English to a high level themselves, why would you learn a language from someone who
                                    has had only poor success in language learning?
</li>
                                <li>In Japan, kids learn characters slowly over a period of 8+ years. This method is extremely inefficient, yet most Japanese teachers do
                                    not question it. I learned characters in 2 years.
</li>
                                <li>A native may not even remember how they learned Japanese anymore. I started learning at 16.</li>
                                <li>As a native English speaker, I know what native English speakers struggle with.</li>
                            </ul>                             
                            <p>I am not a traditional teacher. When I strayed from the traditional learning path 3 years ago, I found myself progressing rapidly in my Japanese ability. I took in “work smarter, not harder” as my motto. Along with that, I realized that learning must be fun and engaging for someone to want to study regularly. As opposed to spoon feeding you grammar, I will coach you on how to make Japanese learning an enjoyable, self-sufficient habit. This, along with efficient study methods, will bring you rapid success.</p>

                                        "Justin has been a great Japanese teacher and coach during my language learning journey.
I have been studying Japanese on-and-off for about five years and was struggling to stay motivated.
Since starting with Justin a few months ago, my Japanese language acquisition has increased and I’m more excited than ever to learn the language."<br>
